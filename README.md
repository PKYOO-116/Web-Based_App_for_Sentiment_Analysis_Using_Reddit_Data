## Web-based Application Development: <br /> Case Study on President Election Sentiment Analysis <br /> Using Firebase Realtime Database for Reddit Posts and Comments

### Team Members: Armand Patel(Leader), Joshua Payapulli, Paul Yoo

### < Project Outline >
The final project report outlines the development of a web-based application for sentiment analysis on Reddit posts to predict U.S. presidential election outcomes. The team, consisting of Armand Patel, Joshua Payapulli, and Paul Yoo, utilized Firebase Realtime Database to manage and store data collected from Reddit, following changes in Twitter's API policy which restricted their initial plan to use Twitter data.

Key aspects of the project include:
1. **Objective**: Develop a web-based application with databases and predict the election outcome by analyzing sentiments from Reddit comments.
2. **Methodology**: The team employed Python scripts for data extraction and sentiment analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), analyzing comments to determine public opinion trends towards presidential candidates.
3. **Database Utilization**: Data was distributed across four Firebase databases using a hash function based on commenter IDs for efficient data allocation and retrieval.
4. **Technical Strategies**: Techniques such as partitioning, replication, and horizontal scaling were implemented to manage large data volumes effectively.
5. **Implementation Changes**: The initial plan was adjusted from using Twitter to Reddit due to policy changes at Twitter, impacting data access.
6. **Data Management and Functionality**: The application supports real-time data interaction, enabling users to insert, update, or delete Reddit posts and analyze sentiment scores.
7. **Outcome and Learning**: The application can predict election outcomes based on sentiment analysis, and the project helped the team gain insights into managing large datasets and developing web-based applications.

The project demonstrated practical applications of data science in political forecasting and provided a robust platform for understanding and analyzing public sentiment, which could significantly influence electoral results.
