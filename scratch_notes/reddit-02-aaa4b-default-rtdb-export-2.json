It's the same issue with Biden constantly saying \"Don't\" and then doing nothing when he gets ignored.\n\nThere's no point making vague threats or demands if you aren't willing to do anything to enforce them. If the judge locked Trump up the first time a warning was ignored, then we wouldn't be dealing with this now.",

I'll play Devil's Advocate - let's just say Trump is right and the *Challenger* in 2020, Joe Buden, managed to rig a Presidential election simultaneously in several states without any evidence being left behind AND/OR having many of Trumps own Cabinet and party members participating in said election fraud. Now fast forward 4 years and that challenger is now the President while you have Trump promising to be a dictator and systematically dismantle the federal government. Again I'm just playing Devil's Advocate so let's say there is a \"Deep State\" hearing all of Trump's threats with an accomplished Election scammer in Joe Buden in the captain's chair - do you think they are just going to hand the reins over to Trump because of some silly election? Its obvious his cult does not think even the simplest thing through. If Trump is indeed right about everything there is no way in Hell he will ever be President again. Think about the capabilities of The United States Government - the military plus all their networking and cybersecurity abilities. If Biden was able to rig it as flawlessly as he did last time imagine what he could do now.",
