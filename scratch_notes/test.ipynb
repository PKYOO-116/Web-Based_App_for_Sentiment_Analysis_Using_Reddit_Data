It's a really weird thing.  Two interviews I saw about this.  One was Jim Parsons (who plays Sheldon in the Big Bang Theory) who was talking about how people would come up to him on the street and ask him to say something smart and science like, or ask him obscure nerd trivia, and him having to explain he is not, in fact, a theoretical physicist, or that much of a comic book/gaming fan, and that everything Sheldon said on the show was written by someone else.  That he's just an actor who played a part and he doesn't really know much of anything about theoretical physics, or nerd culture.\\n\\nThe other was Jenna Fisher, who played Pam on The Office, and how people would approach her with dirty looks when she was out with her husband, and she had to explain she is not, in fact, married to John Krasinski.\", 'downvotes': 0, 'id': 'kzzyzvm', 'keywords': 'Trump', 'permalink': 'https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1c6a286/rightwing_reacher_fans_flip_out_after_alan/kzzyzvm/', 'sentiment_score': 0.6133, 'subreddit': 'Politics', 'timestamp': '2024-04-17 15:25:17', 'title': \"Right-Wing 'Reacher' Fans Flip Out After Alan Ritchson Calls Trump A 'Rapist And A Con-Man'\", 'upvotes': 1}), ('kzzyzw1', {'body': 'Where did all of the MAGA’t poll addicts all of the sudden disappear to?', 'downvotes': 0, 'id': 'kzzyzw1', 'keywords': 'Republican', 'permalink': 'https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1c69x0j/joe_biden_is_now_beating_donald_trump_with/kzzyzw1/', 'sentiment_score': -0.2263, 'subreddit': 'Politics', 'timestamp': '2024-04-17 15:25:18', 'title': 'Joe Biden Is Now Beating Donald Trump With Republican Pollsters as Well', 'upvotes': 1}), ('kzzz24o', {'body': '\"You can\\'t do it!\"\\n\\n-- me from the crowd to Rob', 'downvotes': 0, 'id': 'kzzz24o', 'keywords': 'Trump', 'permalink': 'https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1c6a286/rightwing_reacher_fans_flip_out_after_alan/kzzz24o/', 'sentiment_score': -0.5983, 'subreddit': 'Politics', 'timestamp': '2024-04-17 15:25:39', 'title': \"Right-Wing 'Reacher' Fans Flip Out After Alan Ritchson Calls Trump A 'Rapist And A Con-Man'\", 'upvotes': 1}), ('kzzz5xk', {'body': \"Sweet, I remembered right!

Which kinda makes sense as to why people who identify with being of the same ilk as Trump are less likely to act for the benefit of the collective. Also, there\\'s an interesting bit ab wanting to let people know how moral you are based on that same relationship\\n\\n>* Conducting a large cross-cultural investigation of these relationships and relying on a dataset including data from 67 countries, our results showed that within countries, individual differences in subjective SES were negatively associated with Moral Identity (Fig. 1a), Morality-as-Cooperation (Fig. 1b) as well as Prosocial Intentions in the form of hypothetical donation intentions toward national and international charities (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, between countries, individual differences in subjective SES were negatively associated with the size of one’s Moral Circle (Fig. 1c). As such, individuals who subjectively experience economic scarcity not only seem more inclined to perceive themselves as moral individuals (i.e., Moral Identity), but also seek to project such morality-related aspects toward their peers and in-group members (i.e., Morality-as-Cooperation, Moral Circle, and Prosocial Intentions). Importantly, we show that this relationship, at least to some extent, holds even at the national level, such that individuals living in countries with high economic inequality (GINI), and thus a greater degree of subjective economic scarcity, report a stronger Moral Identity (Fig. 2a) but also a greater Moral Circle (Fig. 2c). These associations are robust in cross-validations\"*\\n\\n>*\"Acting as a moral individual might not be as important if you perceive the world from a more individualistic perspective, which people with subjective higher SES tend to do\"*\\n\\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41007-0', 'downvotes': 0, 'id': 'l004e2s', 'keywords': 'Republican', 'permalink': 'https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1c69x0j/joe_biden_is_now_beating_donald_trump_with/l004e2s/', 'sentiment_score': 0.972, 'subreddit': 'Politics', 'timestamp': '2024-04-17 15:55:16', 'title': 'Joe Biden Is Now Beating Donald Trump With Republican Pollsters as Well', 'upvotes': 1}), ('l004gap', {'body': 'James Woods too.
