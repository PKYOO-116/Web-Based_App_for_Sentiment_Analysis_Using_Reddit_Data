Trump isn't 1,500 miles away sharing posts on social media. \n\nThe trial has started - the judge has almost complete control of his courtroom. Trump has acknowledged he will be arrested if he does not attend. There's a holding cell on the same floor as the courtroom. Witnesses/jurors have to be protected at all costs.\n\nDon't get me wrong - Trump is still going to fly as close to the sun as possible and be afforded more than typical defendants would be - and it will be frustrating at times. \n\nBut I trust Merchan to navigate his court well and there are objectively more serious, immediate consequences available than ever before.",

You\u2019ve got to get even. Get even. And the reason, the reason you do, is so important\u2026The reason you do, you have to do it, because if they do that to you, you have to leave a telltale sign that they just can\u2019t take advantage of you. It\u2019s not so much for the person, which does make you feel good, to be honest with you, I\u2019ve done it many times. But other people watch and you know they say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s leave Trump alone,\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s leave this one,\u201d or \u201cDoris, let\u2019s leave her alone.

Now fast forward 4 years and that challenger is now the President while you have Trump promising to be a dictator and systematically dismantle the federal government. Again I'm just playing Devil's Advocate so let's say there is a \"Deep State\" hearing all of Trump's threats with an accomplished Election scammer in Joe Buden in the captain's chair - do you think they are just going to hand the reins over to Trump because of some silly election? Its obvious his cult does not think even the simplest thing through. If Trump is indeed right about everything there is no way in Hell he will ever be President again.

Crooks like Trump.\n\nSo, he's absolutely going to exploit any aspect of the law he can. \n\nIt's impossible to know if his current lawyers are crooks, but, you gotta think that whoever would take Trump on at this point, are probably not the most moral people of the highest integrity. \n\nSo they or Trump could very well leak the names to someone. That person can give them to someone else, say they got them from a trustworthy source, that person publishes it on twitter, the harassment starts. I'm not sure how exactly this all works, but I'd like to know. Like, if the jury gets threatened, by people, their stuff gets trashed, or whatever, like when is it a mistrial? Is it at the judges discretion? Idk. Because for me, if I'm ok the jury and I get threatened or anything like that, then I'm gonna make sure he's convicted. To me, that's direct proof of guilt, and then some. And I know you're not supposed to use bias outside of what's presented in court, but fuck that.",

That's established.  The majority of their defense is what you see here. Trying to pick jurors who will not vote to convict Trump.  Filing endless motions to delay. Trying to get the case thrown out on highly questionable grounds... etc etc. \n\nBut they have to do all of that in front of this judge, who clearly is not interested in any flavor of bullshit they have available.  \n\nGood luck Donnie. \n\nHe's not gonna see prison time.  I'd love to be wrong, but I just don't think it's in the cards.  But I would be shocked if he isn't convicted on most of the counts.

That's it.\n\nThink of everything this man has done, and that's all that's happened to him.  Even the FBI raid wasn't consequences: he didn't really lose anything.  He probably profited off of some of those documents, so overall it was likely a net gain.  Backing the fake electors hasn't produced consequences, yet, either.\n\nWe keep hearing about \"the wheel of justice is slow\".  No.  That's 90's-era, West Wing style liberal cope.  What's actually happening is we're in a class war, and Trump is in the owning class, being judged by a system created by the owning class, and being treated as if he's in the owning class.  \n\nIf you want people like Trump to be treated like your average person in the criminal justice system: unionize your workplace.
